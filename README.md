# The Lord of the Rings Quiz

The Lord of the Rings quiz is an online quiz based around the three films directed by Peter Jackson. The quiz will directly follow the Fellowship characters along their journey from the Shire through to Mount Doom in Mordor. The quiz is designed to test individual's knowledge of the storyline and provide a fun way for other users to follow the journey with images and cinematics.

As address in the previous paragraph, the quiz will include content extracted from the movies as the journey is played out, along with verbal reactions to correct and incorrect answers using characters from the story. 

When the user first accesses the quiz, they will be brought to a main navigation page which will allow them to interact with each round of the quiz. Starting from left to right, the user will have to attempt each question of the round in order to access the next section. They will not be required to answer all questions correctly. After each round of questions are complete, the user can return back to the main page and select the next round of questions, inline with the story. Once the story is complete, the user will be presented with the results of the entire quiz.

The quiz itself consists of four different styles of questions:
* Standard multiple choice based on a text question
* Multiple choice based on an image
* Anagrams of character names/places
* The covering up of characters faces to enable the user to guess
